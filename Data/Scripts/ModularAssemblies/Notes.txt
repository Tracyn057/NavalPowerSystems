Clutch and direct drive inputs
Clutch is bool based on currentThrottle
Direct drive input is always on
Direct drive only pairs to double reduction gearbox
Clutch only pairs to main reduction gearbox
Direct drive -> double reduction can maintain only single engine connection and single propeller connection -- Old technology
Clutch and main reduction gear has no real max inputs/outputs -- Arleigh Burke: 4 inputs, 2 outputs. Possibly max at 4 each?

Add random component to each time Spool() is called?
Propeller will need RequestedOutput and CurrentOutput -> spool rate for response time.
Main reduction gearbox will need to maintain list of attached clutches and propellers. Sum all inputs based on IsEngaged bool. Clutches need to maintain knowledge of input engine state? 
Gearbox and clutches will need to know what clutch has what input and keep track of on/off bool to know what inputs to use in summation math. Table matching clutch, input power and IsEngaged?
Any link knowledge would be updated OnPartAdd/Remove and OnGridChanged. Not at specific tick intervals.


Production and Extraction output logic change to utilize O2 Generators' push to conveyor network using AddItem intermediary to start output's conversion process. Maybe remove outputs alltogether and maintain 2-block assemblies. 
Input being tank with Stockpile=On and converter itself being the O2 generator spawning items in it's own inventory to convert to "gas".
Items and blueprints+classes already made. Double check accuracy
