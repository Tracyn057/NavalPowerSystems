X Clutch and direct drive inputs
X Clutch is bool based on currentThrottle
X Direct drive input is always on
Direct drive only pairs to double reduction gearbox
Clutch only pairs to main reduction gearbox
Direct drive -> double reduction can maintain only single engine connection and single propeller connection -- Old technology
X Clutch and main reduction gear has no real max inputs/outputs -- Arleigh Burke: 4 inputs, 2 outputs. Possibly max at 4 each?

X Propeller will need RequestedOutput and CurrentOutput -> spool rate for response time.
X Main reduction gearbox will need to maintain list of attached clutches and propellers. Sum all inputs based on IsEngaged bool, maintain authority of IsEngaged.
X Gearboxes maintain list of clutches and propellers. Clutches decide if input power is 0 or current power. Gearbox sums all inputs, all the time. Divides inputs by current propellers. Opens up final output to propellers.
X Propellers look at gearbox final output variable to set requested power. Knows where to look from assembly base block?
X Any link knowledge would be updated OnPartAdd/Remove. Not at specific tick intervals.


X Production and Extraction output logic change to utilize O2 Generators' push to conveyor network using AddItem intermediary to start output's conversion process. Maybe remove outputs alltogether and maintain 2-block assemblies. 
Input being tank with Stockpile=On and converter itself being the O2 generator spawning items in it's own inventory to convert to "gas".
X Items and blueprints+classes already made. Double check accuracy
